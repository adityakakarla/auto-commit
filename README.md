This is a mini-project I've built to speed push to Github.

Nothing crazy. Built with Go.

If you want to run this, use the following steps:

- Navigate to an ideal directory location
- Run ```git clone https://github.com/adityakakarla/auto-commit.git```
- IMPORTANT: Change ```remoteURL``` in ```main()``` to a repo you have access to
- Run ```go run main.go```
